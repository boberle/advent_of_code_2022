You can find the animation on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_Bg0bwaok).

First part (implementation 1): `day10_pt1.c`

First (implementation 2) and second parts: `day10_pt1_2.c`.

Solutions to test file: 13140 (first) and (for the second part):

```
##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..
###...###...###...###...###...###...###.
####....####....####....####....####....
#####.....#####.....#####.....#####.....
######......######......######......####
#######.......#######.......#######.....
```

To make the animation, use `day10_pt1_2_animated.c`. This will print on `stdout` the answers for part 1 and 2, and an html page that you can save in a file. Just open the file in a browser, with JavaScript enable.
